## Bugs

On the Edit page, when a user inputs a blog title, the title is populated next to 'Crrently Editing'. Once the user hits the 'Save Blog' button, the page refreshes, but the blog title stays populated next to 'Currently Editing'. This is not supposed to happen.
## Features

The user of the Bob Blog Blaw Blog is able to view all posted blogs, create blogs and save them (to be viewed on the home page), open, edit and save existing blogs, and can also delete existing blogs. Users are able to read existing blogs on the home page and can see the time and date that each blog was last edited.
